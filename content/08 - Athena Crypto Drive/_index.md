# Athena Crypto Drive
This only works with Athena U2F Token (A custom version of Feitian U2F token)

1. Install Athena Crypto Drive app: c:\pki\tmp\u2fcrypto4100.exe on any Windows version 8 or above computer. No domain or network is required.
1. Upon install completion, run “U2F Crypto”, switch to “New” tab, create your first Crypto Drive, make sure you click Refresh button, and select the the choice with “... Encrypt”, specify the max size of your Crypto Drive, say 15GB, then click “Create” button, you will be prompted to name & save the virtual disk to a location. This may take up to 2 minutes, do NOT interrupt, do NOT touch keyboard or move mouse!!!
1. Upon completion, the U2F Crypto app will switch to the Manage tab automatically. Optionally, you can rename the label by clicking on the gear box.
1. You only need the U2F Crypto App for creating a U2F encrypted drive. Or if you don’t have Admin privileges on your local computer, U2F app can help you mount/unmount vhdx files.
   You can now copy the “.vhdx” file to any Windows computer. Double click the “.vhdx”, you will be prompted to insert your Athena U2F/Smartcard, once you type in the PIN, a new disk drive will show up in your file explorer. Any files on this Athena Crypto Drive will be fully protected with PKI encryption. You can “eject” it just like any portable disk.
